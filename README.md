# TUFFEngine
A Simulation Program that implements the Traffic Simulation Model presented in the following publication. 

Marcelo Zamith ; TOLEDO, R. C. P. L. ; Esteban Clua ; Elson M. Toledo ; Guilherme V.P. Magalh√£es . A new stochastic cellular automata model for traffic flow simulation with drivers behavior prediction. Journal of Computational Science, v. 9, p. 51-56, 2015.  doi:10.1016/j.jocs.2015.04.005

The first program was originally developed by Marcelo Zamith in c++.

This is a netbeans project.


## The Simulation.

  The whole simulation is actually a set of many smaller simulations. The program will do one simulation for each density you need to run.
  
  You can set the densities you want to run using 3 parameters in the configuration file.
  
  The simulation will run from **INITIALDENSITY** to **FINALDENSITY** and will jump **DELTADENSITY** between the densities.
  
  Eg: **INITIALDENSITY=0.05**  **FINALDENSITY=0.90**  **DELTADENSITY=0.01** 
  
  It will simulate the dentities 0.05, 0.06, 0.07 ... 0.50, 0.51, 0.52 ... 0.89, 0.90

## Running the Simulation.
If you just want to run the simulation you only need the files from **TUFFEngineRun** folder.
There you will find 2 files:
- The "TUFFEngine.jar": The program itself.
- The "simulation.txt": The default configuration file.
  A file on this model is required to run the simulation.
  
There are 2 ways of running the simulation.
- #### Using the simulation GUI
  To use the simulation GUI you simply need to click on the "TUFFEngine.jar" file, a window will open and the simulation will run with the parameters set on the 'simulation.txt' file that should be in the same folder.
  
- #### Via prompt:


   If you want to run a configuraton file with a different name you need to run the program via prompt.
   
   To do that you need to open the folder containing the files. Use `cd` command to open teh desired folder.
   
   After that, use the following command to run the simulation.
   
   `java -jar TUFFEngine.jar 'yourConfigFileName.txt'`
   
   The file you pick should be in the same folder.

  
## The Implemented Models.
- #### Nasch With Beta
  ```
  //calculate space between vehicles
  distanceToFront = vehicle.getDistanceToFrontAndId()[0];

        //Calculate new vel, addind acceleratio to vel
        float alpha = vehicle.getBetaFunctionAcc();
        //The rounded version of the alpha calculated above
        float roundA = (float) (Math.round(alpha * 100.0) / 100.0);
        newVel = min(currentVel + (int) (acceleration * (1 - roundA)), vMax);
        //System.out.println((int)(acceleration*(1-roundA)));

        //Caps the new vel bases on the distance to the vehicle on the front
        newVel = min(newVel, distanceToFront);

        //sets the vehicle new vel
        vehicle.setNewVelocity(newVel);
  ```
  


## The Output.
When you run the simulation, it will generate output files.
There are 2 types of logs.
- #### The Main Log
  The main log will be created in all simulations and its name can be set in the **LOGNAME** parameter in the configuration file. eg: `LOGNAME: plotar`
  
  Each line of the log shows statistic information for some time(step) in the simulation, each information is separated by a space.
  
  Those are the parameters you will find in all the lines:
  
   1. Flow
   2. Density
   3. Average Velocity
  
   The steps there are logged are defined by some parameters in the configuration following this rules.
  
   When the step of the simulation is equal to **DISCARDTIME** it will trigger a counter that will increase 1 in each step.
  
   When the counter is equal to **STATISTICTIME** a line will be logged and the counter will be restarted.
   
   This will happen until the end of the **SIMULATIONTIME**
  
 - #### The Picture Log
 
    The idea of this log is that it takes a screenshot of the road in each step of the simulation.
    
    It will create a .txt file for each density simulated, the name will be the density value.

    Each line will have a byte for all the cells in the grid. The byte will be set as **1** if the cell is occupied and **0** if the cell is not occupied.
    
    To turn it on you need to set the **PICTURELOG** parameter in the configuration file to 1. Keep it 0 if you don't need this log.
    
    **WARNING** This is a dangerous log. For example, if your **SIMULATIONTIME** is set to 15000 it will generate a 150mb .txt file for each density simulated.
    
## The Configuration File.
  Use the program Notepad++ to open the configuration file if you have problems using it on the standard notepad.
  
  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
  
  In the standard notepad is usually badly formated.
