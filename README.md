# TUFFEngine
A java version of the TUFF Simulator program that implements the Traffic Simulation Model presented in the following publication. 

Marcelo Zamith ; TOLEDO, R. C. P. L. ; Esteban Clua ; Elson M. Toledo ; Guilherme V.P. Magalh√£es . A new stochastic cellular automata model for traffic flow simulation with drivers behavior prediction. Journal of Computational Science, v. 9, p. 51-56, 2015.  doi:10.1016/j.jocs.2015.04.005

The first program was originally developed by Marcelo Zamith in c++.

This is a netbeans project.

## Running the Simulation.
If you just want to run the simulation you only need the files from **TUFFEngineRun** folder.
There you will find 2 files:
- The "TUFFEngine.jar": The program itself.
- The "simulation.txt": The default configuration file.
  A file on this model is required to run the simulation.
  
There are 2 ways of running the simulation.
- #### Using the simulation GUI
  To use the simulation GUI you simply need to click on the "TUFFEngine.jar" file, a window will open and the simulation will run with the parameters set on the 'simulation.txt' file that should be in the same folder.
  
- #### Via prompt:


   If you want to run a configuraton file with a different name you need to run the program via prompt.
   
   To do that you need to open the folder containing the files. Use `cd` command to open teh desired folder.
   
   After that, use the following command to run the simulation.
   
   `java -jar TUFFEngine.jar 'yourConfigFileName.txt'`
   
   The file you pick should be in the same folder.

  
## The Output.
When you run the simulation, it will generate output files.
There are 2 types of logs.
- #### The Main Log
  The main log will be created in all simulations and its name can be set in the **LOGNAME** parameter in the configuration file. eg: `LOGNAME: plotar`
  
  Each line of the log shows statistic information for some time(step) in the simulation, each information is separated by a space.
  
  Those are the parameters you will find in all the lines:
  1- Flow
  2- Density
  3- Average Velocity
  
  The steps there are logged are defined by some parameters in the configuration following this rules.
  
  When the step of the simulation is equal to **DISCARDTIME** it will trigger a counter that will increase 1 in each step.
  
  When the counter is equal to **STATISTICTIME** a line will be logged and the counter will be restarted.
  
  This will happen until the end of the **SIMULATIONTIME**
